# SMS Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes Algorithm

This project is a machine learning-based SMS spam classifier that utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The classifier is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of SMS messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can easily obtain similar datasets from various sources online. The dataset should consist of two columns: one containing the SMS messages and the other containing their corresponding labels (spam or ham).

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the classifier, ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed. This may include steps such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the messages.

2. **Training the Classifier**: To train the Naive Bayes classifier, run the `train_classifier.py` script. Make sure to provide the path to your preprocessed dataset.

    ```bash
    python train_classifier.py --dataset path_to_dataset.csv
    ```

3. **Testing the Classifier**: After training, you can test the classifier's performance using the `test_classifier.py` script. Again, provide the path to your preprocessed dataset.

    ```bash
    python test_classifier.py --dataset path_to_dataset.csv
    ```

4. **Inference**: Once trained, you can use the trained classifier to predict whether new SMS messages are spam or ham. Use the `predict.py` script and provide the path to a CSV file containing unlabeled SMS messages.

    ```bash
    python predict.py --input path_to_unlabeled_messages.csv
    ```

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the classifier can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated during testing and printed to the console.
